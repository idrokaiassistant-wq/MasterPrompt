I will verify the status of the current deployment, as the logs you provided appear to be from a previous failed attempt (showing `npm ci` and `node:18`, which I have already updated to `pnpm` and `node:20`).

I will:

1. Check the real-time logs of the currently running build to confirm if the fixes (switching to pnpm and Node 20) have resolved the issue.
2. If the current build is successful, I will confirm that the system is operational.
3. If there are new errors in the current build, I will address them immediately.
